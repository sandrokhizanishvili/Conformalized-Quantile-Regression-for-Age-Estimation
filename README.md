# Conformalized Quantile Regression for Age Estimation

This repository contains the final project for the Advanced Machine Learning course at Sapienza University of Rome.

We developed a conformalized quantile regression framework for age estimation from images. Our approach adaptively quantifies uncertainty, providing reliable prediction intervals for estimated ages.
